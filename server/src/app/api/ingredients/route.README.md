# route.ts - Ingredients API Route

This file defines the API route for managing ingredients in the WeaverLabs MVP at:
`server/src/app/api/ingredients/route.ts`

## Purpose
Handles HTTP requests to `/api/ingredients` for CRUD operations on ingredient data stored in a local JSON file.

## Key Components
- **Imports**: Uses Node.js `fs` and `path` for file and path operations.
- **DATA_PATH**: Location of `data.json` for ingredient data.
- **readData()**: Reads and parses the JSON data file.

## API Handlers
- **GET**: Returns all ingredients as JSON.
- **POST**: Adds a new ingredient with a unique ID and returns it.
- **DELETE**: Removes an ingredient by ID and returns a success response.

## Data Persistence
- Reads from `data.json` for each request.
- Data changes (POST/DELETE) are in-memory only; file writing is commented out for development safety.

## TypeScript Usage
- Type annotations for function parameters.
- Interfaces for ingredients recommended for better type safety.

## Limitations
- No error handling for file operations or invalid input.
- Data changes are not persisted to disk.
- No authentication or validation.

## Opportunities for Improvement
- Add error handling for file operations and request validation.
- Implement a `writeData()` function to persist changes.
- Define and use TypeScript interfaces for ingredients and request bodies.
- Modularize file operations if the codebase grows.

This file provides core backend logic for ingredient management, supporting basic CRUD operations with a simple, file-based approach suitable for rapid prototyping.
