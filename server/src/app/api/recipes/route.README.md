# route.ts - Recipes API Route

This file implements the API route for managing recipes in the WeaverLabs MVP. It is located at:

`server/src/app/api/recipes/route.ts`

## Purpose
Handles HTTP requests to `/api/recipes` for CRUD operations on recipe data stored in a local JSON file.

## Key Components
- **Imports**: Uses Node.js `path` for path resolution. (Note: `fs` and Next.js imports are referenced but not shown; ensure they are present.)
- **DATA_PATH**: Points to the `data.json` file containing recipe data.
- **readData()**: Reads and parses the JSON data file.

## API Handlers
- **GET**: Returns all recipes as a JSON array.
- **POST**: Adds a new recipe with a unique ID, appends it to the list, and returns it.
- **DELETE**: Removes a recipe by ID and returns a success response.

## Data Persistence
- Data is read from `data.json` for every request.
- Changes to data (POST/DELETE) are currently only in memory; file writing is commented out for safety during development.

## TypeScript Usage
- Type annotations for function parameters are used.
- Consider defining interfaces for recipe objects for improved type safety.

## Limitations
- No error handling for file operations or invalid input.
- Data changes are not persisted to disk.
- No authentication or validation.

## Opportunities for Improvement
- Implement error handling for file operations and request validation.
- Add a `writeData()` function to persist changes.
- Define and use TypeScript interfaces for recipes and request bodies.
- Modularize file operations if the codebase grows.

This file provides core backend logic for recipe management, supporting basic CRUD operations with a simple, file-based approach suitable for rapid prototyping.
